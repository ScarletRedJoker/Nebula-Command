# Nebula Command - HomeLabHub Platform

## Overview
Nebula Command, also known as the HomeLabHub Platform, is a comprehensive suite for homelab management, Discord community integration, and multi-platform streaming. It comprises a Dashboard for homelab control and AI assistance, a Discord Bot for community and notification management, and a Stream Bot for automated content posting across streaming platforms. The platform's vision is to offer a unified control plane for homelab enthusiasts, providing advanced features for automation, monitoring, and interaction within their digital environments.

## User Preferences
- **User:** Evin
- **Managed Domains:** rig-city.com, evindrake.net, scarletredjoker.com
- **Development Workflow:** Edit in Replit → Push to GitHub → Pull on Ubuntu servers
- **Database:** Shared PostgreSQL (Neon in dev, homelab-postgres in prod)
- **Secrets:** .env file (never commit), Replit Secrets in dev

### Deployment Preference
When Evin asks to "deploy", this means:
1. **Linode**: `ssh root@linode.evindrake.net` → `cd /opt/homelab/HomeLabHub/deploy/linode && ./deploy.sh`
2. **Local Ubuntu**: `ssh evin@host.evindrake.net` → `cd /opt/homelab/HomeLabHub/deploy/local && ./deploy.sh`

Each server deploys ONLY its own services. They are separate and independent.

## System Architecture

### Core Services
The platform consists of three main services:
-   **Dashboard (Next.js 14)**: Modern web interface for homelab management built with TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. Features include:
    - **Monaco Code Editor**: File tree navigation, syntax highlighting, multi-file editing
    - **Visual Website Designer**: Drag-drop component builder with live preview
    - **AI Assistant (Jarvis)**: OpenAI-powered chat for homelab commands and automation
    - **Service Manager**: Docker integration, container control, logs viewer
    - **Deployment Pipeline**: One-click deploys to Linode and Home servers
    - **Server Management**: SSH terminals, resource metrics, health monitoring
    - JWT-signed sessions (HMAC-SHA256) for secure authentication
    - Professional dark theme with responsive design
-   **Discord Bot (Node.js/React)**: Handles Discord community management, including a ticket system, music bot, stream notifications, and analytics. It integrates with the Stream Bot for go-live alerts and offers multi-tenant security.
-   **Stream Bot (Node.js/React/Vite)**: Manages multi-platform content posting and interaction across Twitch, YouTube, and Kick. It supports OAuth, per-user personalization, token encryption, rate limiting, and anti-spam measures, with a modernized UI.

### Cross-Service Integration
Services share a PostgreSQL database and Redis for caching. The Stream Bot uses webhooks for Discord go-live notifications. The Dashboard and Discord Bot communicate via APIs. The Discord Bot integrates with Plex for "Now Playing" status and Lanyard for rich presence. The entire system is multi-tenant with user roles and RBAC.

### Deployment and Hosting
The system is deployed on two independent servers:
-   **Linode Cloud**: Hosts the Dashboard, Discord Bot, and Stream Bot.
-   **Local Ubuntu**: Hosts local homelab services like Plex, MinIO, and Home Assistant.
Each server utilizes separate deployment scripts.

### Tailscale Connectivity
Linode utilizes a Tailscale sidecar container to access local services on the Ubuntu homelab, including Plex, Home Assistant, MinIO, and a KVM/Sunshine gaming VM. The `tailscale` container operates in `network_mode: host` to route all Linode container traffic through the Tailscale network.

### Database Schema
A shared PostgreSQL instance organizes data into distinct databases for each service:
-   `homelab_jarvis`: Dashboard data (AI conversations, Docker, audit logs).
-   `discord_bot`: Discord Bot data (tickets, messages, server configs, stream notifications).
-   `stream_bot`: Stream Bot data (configurations, platform connections, message history).

### KVM Gaming VM (Sunshine/Moonlight)
A KVM VM named `RDPWindows` is configured with GPU passthrough (NVIDIA RTX 3060) and a Tailscale IP (`100.118.44.102`). It features robust startup scripts that handle GPU D3cold recovery, stale process cleanup, retry logic, and health monitoring. Moonlight can connect via Tailscale or local LAN.

### Local Ubuntu Server Configuration
The local Ubuntu server mounts a NAS share (`//192.168.0.185/networkshare`) at `/srv/media` using CIFS with `noauto,x-systemd.automount` for boot safety. Key services run in Docker containers, including Plex, Home Assistant, MinIO, and Caddy.

### Stream Bot OBS Overlays
The Stream Bot offers an overlay editor for OBS, allowing visual drag-and-drop customization of text, images, and alerts. Overlays can be exported as JSON or saved in-memory. Specific URLs are provided for Spotify, YouTube, and custom overlays.

### Recent Fixes (January 2026)
- **Stream Bot Rate Limiter Fixed**: Increased auth limit from 5 to 50 requests, added skipSuccessfulRequests for OAuth flows
- **Discord Bot Dashboard Simplified**: Reduced from 11 tabs to 5 core tabs (Overview, Tickets, Streams, Welcome, Commands) + "More Tools" dropdown
- **qBittorrent + VPN Setup Added**: Created deploy/local/torrent-vpn/ with gluetun container for private torrenting
- **OAuth CSRF/Session Fixes**: Fixed session configuration (resave:true, saveUninitialized:true) to persist OAuth state tokens before redirect - fixes "CSRF validation failed" errors
- **OAuth Redirect URI Auto-Correction**: Added auto-fix for misconfigured redirect URIs that use `/api/auth/*` instead of `/auth/*` or include port numbers in HTTPS URLs
- **Discord Bot CORS Fixed**: Added discord.rig-city.com to allowed origins for dashboard API access
- **Stream Bot Legacy Route Handler**: Added /success/* path handler to redirect legacy OAuth success URLs to proper query params
- **Production Config Fixed**: Corrected DISCORD_BOT_URL (port 5000 → 4000) and OAuth redirect URIs in docker-compose.yml

### Powerhouse Features (January 2026)
Eight major features were added to transform the platform into an ultimate powerhouse for developers and content creators:

### Discord Bot Stream Notifications
Stream notifications require explicit setup by configuring a channel and tracking streamers via Discord commands. Detection works by monitoring Discord presence and polling Twitch/YouTube APIs. Users must link their streaming platforms to Discord for detection.

## Security & Secret Management

### Critical Security Incident (January 4, 2026)
The Discord bot token was accidentally exposed when the GitHub repository was briefly made public. Token was immediately regenerated and rotated across all environments.

### Implemented Protections
1. **Git Pre-commit Hooks**: Enhanced pre-commit hook installed on all development environments
   - Run `./scripts/setup-git-secrets.sh` on any new machine
   - Detects Discord tokens, API keys, OAuth secrets, private keys
   - Blocks commits containing suspicious patterns

2. **Protected Patterns**:
   - Discord tokens (old and new format)
   - OpenAI/Anthropic API keys
   - Tailscale auth/API keys
   - Cloudflare tokens
   - OAuth client secrets
   - AWS credentials
   - Private keys

3. **Environment Files**:
   - All `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
   - Use `.env.template` for documentation
   - Never commit actual secrets

### Secret Rotation Procedure
When a secret is compromised:
1. Regenerate the secret immediately in the provider's dashboard
2. Update Replit Secrets (development)
3. Update `.env` on Linode: `ssh root@linode.evindrake.net`, edit `/opt/homelab/HomeLabHub/deploy/linode/.env`
4. Update `.env` on Local Ubuntu: `ssh evin@host.evindrake.net`, edit `/opt/homelab/HomeLabHub/deploy/local/.env`
5. Restart affected services on all environments
