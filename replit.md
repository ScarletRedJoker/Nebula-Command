# Nebula Command Dashboard Project

## Overview
The Nebula Command Dashboard is a web-based interface for managing a Ubuntu 25.10 server hosting 15 Docker-based services. These services are accessible via custom subdomains and include homelab management, Discord/Twitch bots, media streaming, remote desktop access, and home automation. The project aims to provide a centralized, robust, and secure platform for managing a comprehensive homelab environment, integrating various functionalities for personal and community use.

## Latest Changes (November 28, 2025)

### Jarvis/Continue.dev Integration Fix
- **Secure API Key Handling:** Created `config/code-server/continue-config.ts` that reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `process.env` instead of hardcoding
- **Docker Mount Updated:** Changed from `config.json` to `config.ts` in docker-compose.yml
- **Custom Commands:** `/homelab-fix`, `/homelab-review`, `/homelab-deploy`, `/homelab-status`
- **System Prompt:** Jarvis configured as AI assistant for Nebula Command homelab

### Stream-bot Public Fact Feed
- **New Page:** Added `/fact-feed` route showing community fact history
- **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/facts/public` with pagination, search, filtering
- **Security:** Only AI-generated facts shown (source: 'stream-bot' or 'openai'), excludes manual/admin entries
- **Features:** Tag filtering, search, sort by newest/oldest, responsive grid layout

### Dashboard Cleanup
- **Removed AI Facts:** Deleted redundant facts page from dashboard (now in stream-bot)
- **Fixed Compose References:** Changed `docker-compose.unified.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`

### OAuth Status (All Platforms Working)
- Twitch OAuth: ✓ Configured
- YouTube OAuth: ✓ Configured with PKCE
- Spotify OAuth: ✓ Configured with PKCE
- Kick OAuth: ✓ Configured

### Bootstrap Fixes
- **Discord Bot Missing Packages:** Added `openai`, `p-limit`, and `p-retry` to dependencies - was causing "Cannot find package" errors on startup
- **Migration 017 Concurrency Fix:** Updated enum creation to use PostgreSQL DO blocks with EXCEPTION handlers for idempotent execution - prevents "invalid input value for enum" errors during concurrent migrations
- **Celery Worker Migration Prevention:** Added RUN_MIGRATIONS check to app.py - workers now skip migrations (RUN_MIGRATIONS=false) while dashboard runs them

## Code-Server X-Frame-Options Fix (November 26, 2025)
- **Problem:** code-server was sending `X-Frame-Options: DENY` header, blocking VS Code's internal extension host iframe and causing "No default agent contributed" errors
- **Solution:** Added nginx sidecar proxy (`code-server-proxy`) between Caddy and code-server that strips the restrictive header using `proxy_hide_header X-Frame-Options` and sets `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` with proper CSP `frame-ancestors` directive
- **Flow:** Caddy → nginx (code-server-proxy:8080) → code-server:8443
- **Files:** `config/code-server-proxy/nginx.conf`, updated `docker-compose.yml` and `Caddyfile`

## User Preferences
- User: Evin
- Ubuntu 25.10 server at host.evindrake.net
- Project location: `/home/evin/contain/HomeLabHub`
- Development: Edit in cloud IDE → Push to GitHub → Pull on Ubuntu server
- All services use shared PostgreSQL (homelab-postgres) with individual databases
- Main password: `Brs=2729` (used for most services)
- Managed domains: rig-city.com, evindrake.net, scarletredjoker.com

## Database Architecture
- **PostgreSQL 16 Alpine** - Centralized database server (`homelab-postgres`)
- **Databases:**
  - `streambot` (user: streambot) - Stream Bot service
  - `homelab_jarvis` (user: jarvis) - Dashboard & Jarvis AI
  - `ticketbot` (user: ticketbot) - Discord Bot
- **Orchestration:** `services/dashboard/services/database_orchestrator.py` handles migrations, health checks, and schema verification
- **Init Scripts:** `config/postgres-init/00-init-all-databases.sh` provisions all databases on first startup

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The dashboard is a Flask-based management UI using Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js for visualization. Bot interfaces are built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI.

### Technical Implementations
The core system relies on Docker Compose for orchestrating 15 services. A `bootstrap-homelab.sh` script provides idempotent fresh installations with pre-flight checks, rollback capabilities, and comprehensive validation. A `./homelab` script offers day-to-day management, including fixing issues, checking status, viewing logs, restarting services, health checks, database operations (backup/restore), and updates.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard & AI:** Flask UI with Jarvis AI assistant (GPT-4o), Agent Swarm (5 specialized AI agents), Voice Interface, Docker/system monitoring, JWT token management UI.
- **Storage & Data:** NAS Management, Storage Monitor, Database Admin (PostgreSQL management), File Manager, Plex Media Import (drag-and-drop), Automated backup system.
- **Bots:** Discord ticket bot and multi-platform stream bot (SnappleBotAI for Twitch/Kick/YouTube).
- **Services:** Remote Ubuntu desktop (Host VNC - TigerVNC + noVNC, not containerized), VS Code in browser (code-server), Plex media server, n8n workflow automation, Home Assistant.
- **App Marketplace:** One-click deployment of 5 pre-configured applications (WordPress, Nextcloud, Gitea, Uptime Kuma, Portainer).
- **Static Sites:** Hosting for rig-city.com and scarletredjoker.com.
- **Notification System:** Multi-channel alerts (Discord, Email) for service health, storage thresholds, backup failures, and OAuth token expiry.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Prometheus with 15+ alert rules, Grafana dashboards, Loki log aggregation, automated alerting.
- **DNS Automation:** Auto-sync DNS records to Cloudflare when services change, Traefik route watching.
- **Security:** Automatic SSL via Caddy/Let's Encrypt, environment-based secrets, isolated database credentials, password-protected VNC/Code Server, rate limiting, CSRF protection, JWT authentication.

### System Design Choices
- **Containerization:** All services are Dockerized and managed by Docker Compose.
- **Centralized Database:** A single PostgreSQL container (`homelab-postgres`) serves as the shared database for all services.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Caddy handles reverse proxying and automatic SSL.
- **Environment Management:** All configuration is managed via a single `.env` file at the project root.
- **Modular Architecture:** Designed for easy addition of new services.
- **Authentication:** Centralized session-based authentication using `session['authenticated']`.
- **Homelab Transformation:** Implemented an 8-phase roadmap covering configuration foundation (SOPS, Jinja2 templates), modular service packaging, service discovery & networking (Consul, Traefik), database platform upgrade (pgBouncer, pgBackRest), observability & auto-recovery (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki), deployment & rollback automation (GitHub Actions), API Gateway & Auth (Traefik, JWT), and DNS Automation (Cloudflare API integration). Each service is designed to own its data, UI, and API.
