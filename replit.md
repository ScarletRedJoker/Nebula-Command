### Database Architecture
A single PostgreSQL container (`discord-bot-db`) hosts multiple databases (`ticketbot`, `streambot`). Init scripts auto-configure databases and users.

### Unified Deployment System
- `homelab-manager.sh`: A single control panel for all operations including deployment, service control, database management, configuration, troubleshooting, code syncing, and updates.
- `docker-compose.unified.yml`: Orchestrates all 8 services.
- Caddy reverse proxy: Provides automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt.
- Automated Replit → Ubuntu Sync: Scripts (`sync-from-replit.sh`, `install-auto-sync.sh`) facilitate automatic code synchronization every 5 minutes.
