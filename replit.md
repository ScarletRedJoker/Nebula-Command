# Homelab Dashboard Project

## Recent Updates (November 2024)

### Production Fixes & Master Fix Script
**Date**: November 16, 2024  
**Status**: Master recovery script created

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Auto-sync Bug**: Added DOCKER_COMPOSE detection in deployment/sync-from-replit.sh preventing hardened sync failures
2. **Moonlight Page Readability**: Changed low-contrast text-muted to text-white/text-white-50 for better visibility
3. **Master Fix Script**: Created MASTER_FIX_ALL.sh - ONE simple script that fixes everything

**MASTER_FIX_ALL.sh - The ONE Script to Fix Everything:**
- **Step 1**: Validates .env has required passwords (JARVIS_DB_PASSWORD, STREAMBOT_DB_PASSWORD, POWERDNS_DB_PASSWORD)
- **Step 2**: Ensures infrastructure healthy (postgres, redis, minio) with health checks
- **Step 3**: Fixes all database user passwords and grants privileges
- **Step 4**: Flushes Redis cache to clear stale CSRF/session data
- **Step 5**: Rebuilds broken containers (discord-bot, stream-bot) with --no-cache
- **Step 6**: Restarts all services in dependency order with health checks
- **Step 7**: Shows status and test URLs

**Run Command (Ubuntu):**
```bash
cd /home/evin/contain/HomeLabHub
bash MASTER_FIX_ALL.sh
```

**What It Fixes:**
- CSRF token errors (clears Redis cache)
- Database authentication failures (syncs passwords)
- discord-bot restart loops (missing winston package)
- stream-bot crashes (bundling errors)
- Service dependency issues (proper startup order)

**Prerequisites:**
- .env file must exist with required passwords
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Containers must be defined in docker-compose.unified.yml

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The Homelab Dashboard features a cosmic theme with deep space backgrounds, animated starfields, nebula gradients, and glassmorphic UI panels, adhering to WCAG AA Accessibility standards. The Jarvis Voice Chat and mobile UI are fully responsive, incorporating cosmic themes and touch-friendly design. The Stream Bot uses a "candy theme" with gradients, glassmorphism, rounded edges, and glow effects.
