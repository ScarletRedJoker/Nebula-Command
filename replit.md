# Nebula Command Dashboard Project

## Overview
The Nebula Command Dashboard is a web-based interface for managing a Ubuntu 25.10 server hosting 15 Docker-based services. These services are accessible via custom evindrake.net subdomains and include homelab management, Discord/Twitch bots, media streaming, remote desktop access, and home automation. The project aims to provide a centralized, robust, and secure platform for managing a comprehensive homelab environment, integrating various functionalities for personal and community use.

## User Preferences
- User: Evin
- Ubuntu 25.10 server at host.evindrake.net
- Project location: `/home/evin/contain/HomeLabHub`
- Development: Edit in cloud IDE → Push to GitHub → Pull on Ubuntu server
- All services use shared PostgreSQL (homelab-postgres) with individual databases
- Main password: `Brs=2729` (used for most services)
- Managed domains: rig-city.com, evindrake.net, scarletredjoker.com

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The dashboard is a Flask-based management UI using Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js for visualization. Bot interfaces are built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI.

### Technical Implementations
The core system relies on Docker Compose for orchestrating 15 services. A `bootstrap-homelab.sh` script provides idempotent fresh installations with pre-flight checks, rollback capabilities, and comprehensive validation. A `./homelab` script offers day-to-day management, including fixing issues, checking status, viewing logs, restarting services, health checks, database operations (backup/restore), and updates.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard & AI:** Flask UI with Jarvis AI assistant (GPT-4o-mini), Agent Swarm (5 specialized AI agents), Voice Interface, Docker/system monitoring, JWT token management UI.
- **Storage & Data:** NAS Management (Zyxel NAS326), Storage Monitor (Plex/DB/Docker/MinIO analytics), Database Admin (PostgreSQL management), File Manager, Plex Media Import (drag-and-drop), Automated backup system with cron scheduling.
- **Bots:** Discord ticket bot (TypeScript, React, Drizzle ORM) and multi-platform stream bot (SnappleBotAI for Twitch/Kick/YouTube).
- **Services:** Remote Ubuntu desktop (VNC), VS Code in browser (code-server), Plex media server, n8n workflow automation, Home Assistant.
- **App Marketplace:** One-click deployment of 5 pre-configured applications (WordPress, Nextcloud, Gitea, Uptime Kuma, Portainer).
- **Static Sites:** Hosting for rig-city.com and scarletredjoker.com with mobile-optimized contact pages.
- **Notification System:** Multi-channel alerts (Discord, Email) for service health, storage thresholds, backup failures, and OAuth token expiry.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Prometheus with 15+ alert rules, Grafana dashboards, Loki log aggregation, automated alerting.
- **DNS Automation:** Auto-sync DNS records to Cloudflare when services change, Traefik route watching.
- **Security:** Automatic SSL via Caddy/Let's Encrypt, environment-based secrets, isolated database credentials per service, password-protected VNC/Code Server, rate limiting, CSRF protection, JWT authentication.

### System Design Choices
- **Containerization:** All services are Dockerized and managed by Docker Compose.
- **Centralized Database:** A single PostgreSQL container (`homelab-postgres`) serves as the shared database for all services, with individual databases and user credentials for each.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Caddy handles reverse proxying and automatic SSL for all services.
- **Environment Management:** All configuration is managed via a single `.env` file at the project root, loaded by Docker via absolute paths.
- **Modular Architecture:** Designed for easy addition of new services by modifying `docker-compose.yml` and Caddy configuration.
- **Authentication:** Centralized session-based authentication using `session['authenticated']` across all routes and blueprints.

## Recent Changes (November 2025)

### AI Model Standardization (November 24, 2025) - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Problem**: Mixed AI model configuration causing fact generation failures
- **Root Cause**: Stream-bot using non-existent models (gpt-5-mini from old migration, gpt-4o-mini in various files)
- **Solution**: Standardized all services to use correct OpenAI models
- **Implementation**:
  - **Stream-Bot Facts**: Now uses `gpt-4o` (most capable model for fact generation)
  - **Dashboard Jarvis**: Uses `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective for chatbot)
  - Updated 15 files across stream-bot codebase to default to gpt-4o
  - Fixed migration 0000_broad_speedball.sql DEFAULT value
  - Created data migration fix-ai-model-config.sql to update existing records
  - Updated docker-compose.yml: STREAMBOT_FACT_MODEL=gpt-4o
  - Updated .env.example with correct model defaults
- **Service Separation Verification**: Each service owns its own data completely
  - Stream-bot: owns facts (database, API, UI, generation logic)
  - Dashboard: owns Jarvis AI sessions (read-only proxy to stream-bot for facts)
  - Discord-bot: owns tickets and Discord data
- **Status**: ✅ Verified working in development (gpt-4o generates facts successfully)
- **Deployment**: Automated script created (deploy-fix.sh) for production deployment
- **Documentation**: COMPLETE_SERVICE_SEPARATION_FIX.md, SERVICE_OWNERSHIP.md, DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md

### Facts Feature Architecture Fix (November 24, 2025) - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Problem**: Facts were incorrectly implemented in dashboard service (service mixing violation)
- **Root Cause**: AI assistant initially stored stream-bot facts in dashboard's Artifact table
- **Solution**: Complete architectural refactor - stream-bot now owns facts end-to-end
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `facts` table to stream-bot database schema (shared/schema.ts)
  - Created migration 0006_add_facts_table.sql in stream-bot
  - Added POST /api/facts endpoint to stream-bot Express API
  - Added GET /api/facts/latest and GET /api/facts/random endpoints with wrapped responses
  - Stream-bot generates facts IMMEDIATELY on startup + hourly (OpenAI GPT-4o)
  - Stream-bot POSTs to itself (localhost:5000), not to dashboard
  - Fixed timing issue: Server listens before fact generation starts
- **Dashboard Changes**: Reverted to read-only proxy pattern (dashboard/routes/facts_routes.py)
- **Service Separation**: Each service (stream-bot, dashboard, discord-bot) owns its own data, UI, and API completely
- **Status**: ✅ Tested and verified working in development (facts generate on startup and store successfully)
- **Deployment**: Migration 0006 applied to production, container rebuild needed
- **Files**: services/stream-bot/shared/schema.ts, migrations/0006_add_facts_table.sql, server/routes.ts, server/index.ts

## Recent Changes (November 2025)

### Navigation Expansion
- Added 5 missing features to sidebar navigation: NAS Management, Storage Monitor, Database Admin, File Manager, and App Marketplace
- All features were fully implemented but not previously exposed in UI

### Authentication Standardization
- Fixed authentication mismatches across 9 route files (storage, db_admin, plex, artifact, unified_logs, upload, analysis, game_streaming, storage_optimization)
- All custom `login_required` decorators now check `session.get('authenticated')` instead of `session['logged_in']`
- Aligns with centralized auth system in `utils/auth.py` and `web.py`

### NAS Integration
- Documented NAS configuration in `.env.example` (NAS_IP, NAS_HOSTNAME, NAS_USER, NAS_PASSWORD, NAS_MOUNT_BASE)
- Supports Zyxel NAS326 with SMB/CIFS mounting, auto-discovery, and backup scheduling

### Homepage Enhancement
- Added AI & Media Control card with responsive layout (col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-12)
- Quick access buttons for Plex Import, Jarvis AI, Agent Swarm, and Voice Interface

### Documentation
- Created `COMPLETE_FEATURE_LIST.md` with comprehensive feature inventory
- 50+ features across 7 categories
- 31 HTML templates, 16 database migrations, 15 services cataloged

### Database Configuration Fix (Critical)
- Fixed database URL resolver to auto-build connection strings from password components
- Prevents common configuration error where JARVIS_DATABASE_URL contains placeholder text "JARVIS_DB_PASSWORD"
- Now auto-detects placeholders and builds correct URL from JARVIS_DB_PASSWORD
- Created `DATABASE_CONFIG_FIX.md` documenting the issue and solution
- Updated diagnostic script to detect this specific configuration mistake

### Jarvis AI OpenAI Integration Fix (Critical - November 23, 2025)
- **Problem:** Jarvis AI was returning 400 errors because OPENAI_API_KEY was not available in the dashboard container
- **Root Cause:** Docker Compose's `env_file` directive loads variables but doesn't automatically expose them to the container
- **Solution:** Explicitly added `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `WEB_USERNAME`, and `WEB_PASSWORD` to the `environment` section of the `homelab-dashboard` service in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Result:** Jarvis AI Assistant now fully functional with GPT-3.5-turbo integration
- Created `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` with comprehensive deployment and verification steps
- Created `quick-fix-jarvis.sh` for rapid deployment and testing on production server
