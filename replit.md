### November 18, 2025 - VNC Desktop & Code-Server Fixes
**Fixed critical issues preventing VNC login and code-server access**

**Problems Identified:**
1. **Code-Server Down:** Permission errors (EACCES) - volume owned by root, code-server runs as UID 1000
2. **VNC Login Failing:** x11vnc crash on startup - password file stored in wrong location (`/.password2` vs user home)

**Root Causes:**
- Code-server volume `code_server_data` created with root ownership, incompatible with container user (1000:1000)
- VNC base image (`dorowu/ubuntu-desktop-lxde-vnc`) stores password in root directory instead of `/home/evin/.vnc/passwd`

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. ✅ Created `deployment/fix-vnc-and-code-server.sh` - One-command fix for both issues
2. ✅ Created `services/vnc-desktop/fix-vnc-password.sh` - Startup script that properly sets VNC password location
3. ✅ Updated VNC Dockerfile to run password fix before container startup
4. ✅ Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide (`TROUBLESHOOTING_VNC_CODE_SERVER.md`)

**Fix Script Features:**
```bash
./deployment/fix-vnc-and-code-server.sh
```
- Fixes code-server volume ownership (1000:1000)
- Rebuilds VNC Desktop with password fix
- Restarts services and verifies health
- Provides troubleshooting output

**Technical Details:**
- Code-server fix: `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /var/lib/docker/volumes/code_server_data/_data`
- VNC fix: Added `x11vnc -storepasswd` to create password file at `/home/evin/.vnc/passwd`
- VNC Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT: `fix-vnc-password.sh → bootstrap.sh → startup.sh`

**User Action Required (on Ubuntu):**
```bash
cd /home/evin/contain/HomeLabHub
./deployment/fix-vnc-and-code-server.sh
```

## Recent Changes

### November 18, 2025 - Modular Database Provisioning System
**BREAKING CHANGE: Automatic database setup - manual scripts removed**

**New Architecture:**
- ✅ **Automatic Database Provisioning** - PostgreSQL init scripts create ALL databases on first startup
- ✅ **Zero Manual Steps** - No more fix scripts, everything is plug-and-play
- ✅ **Linear Deployment** - Single command (`./deployment/linear-deploy.sh`) validates, provisions, deploys, and verifies
- ✅ **Modular Services** - Each service has dedicated database and user with proper isolation
- ✅ **Health Checks** - Docker Compose uses service_healthy conditions for proper startup ordering

**Database Architecture (AUTOMATIC CREATION):**
- `ticketbot` - PostgreSQL superuser, manages Discord bot database
- `streambot` - Stream Bot database user (auto-created on first startup)
- `jarvis` - Dashboard database user (auto-created on first startup)
- All databases created automatically by `config/postgres-init/00-init-all-databases.sh`

**Security Improvements:**
- SQL injection prevention with psql variable binding (`:'pwd'`)
- Shell expansion prevention with password sanitization
- Command injection prevention with proper quoting
- Triple-tested security (SQL injection, shell expansion, command substitution)

**Deployment Scripts:**
- `deployment/linear-deploy.sh` - NEW: One-command deployment (validate → provision → launch → verify)
- `deployment/FIX_EVERYTHING_NOW.sh` - UPDATED: Simplified to 3 steps (removed manual DB creation)
- `deployment/FIX_DATABASE_USERS.sh` - REMOVED: Obsolete (functionality in init scripts)
- `homelab-manager.sh` - UPDATED: Removed subscription code, option 1 uses linear deployment

**User Experience:**
```bash
# Old Way (Manual):
1. Run env validation
2. Run database fix script
3. Rebuild services
4. Restart services  
5. Check logs for errors
6. Repeat if failed

# New Way (Automatic):
./deployment/linear-deploy.sh  # One command, everything works!
```

### November 18, 2025 - Complete Infrastructure Fix (Database Users + Environment Variables)
**Problems Identified:**
1. Stream-bot/Dashboard: Password authentication failures (old passwords baked into Docker images)
2. Code-server: Persistent EACCES permission errors (volume owned by root, not UID 1000)
3. VNC Desktop: Long build times (LibreOffice/Evince bloat, no layer caching, chromium snap stub)
4. **Database Users Missing:** streambot and jarvis users not created in PostgreSQL (init scripts exist but never ran)

**Root Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Container Env Vars:** Docker build bakes env vars into images - restart doesn't reload from .env
   - ✅ Solution: Clean rebuild with `--no-cache` forces fresh env var read
   - ✅ Updated `homelab-manager.sh` to always use `--no-cache` for full deploy
2. **Code-server Permissions:** Volume created with root ownership, container runs as UID 1000
   - ✅ Solution: Created `deployment/FIX_EVERYTHING_NOW.sh` with sudo chown for volumes
3. **VNC Build Optimization:** Monolithic package install, no caching, 500MB+ bloat, chromium-browser snap stub
   - ✅ Solution: 3-layer caching strategy, removed LibreOffice/Evince/Chromium (5-7min faster builds)
4. **Database Users Not Created:** PostgreSQL init scripts exist in `config/postgres-init/` but didn't run on existing database
   - ✅ Solution: Created `deployment/FIX_DATABASE_USERS.sh` to manually create streambot and jarvis users
   - ✅ Integrated into `deployment/FIX_EVERYTHING_NOW.sh` for automatic fix

**Database Architecture (NOW FIXED):**
- ✅ `ticketbot` - PostgreSQL superuser, manages Discord bot database
- ✅ `streambot` - Dedicated user for Stream Bot database (least privilege) - **NOW CREATED**
- ✅ `jarvis` - Dedicated user for Dashboard database (least privilege) - **NOW CREATED**
- ✅ Each service has its own isolated database and user (proper security model)

**Environment Variable Validation:**
- ✅ Created `deployment/check-all-env-vars.sh` - validates ALL 40+ environment variables
- ✅ Checks required vars for: Dashboard, Stream Bot, Discord Bot, PostgreSQL, VNC, Code Server, MinIO, Home Assistant
- ✅ Prevents deployment with missing critical environment variables

**Complete Fix Scripts:**
- `deployment/FIX_EVERYTHING_NOW.sh` - Fixes code-server permissions, creates DB users, rebuilds services
- `deployment/FIX_DATABASE_USERS.sh` - Creates streambot and jarvis PostgreSQL users
- `deployment/check-all-env-vars.sh` - Validates all environment variables
- `deployment/UBUNTU_COMPLETE_FIX.sh` - One-command fix: pulls code, validates env vars, fixes everything, verifies sites

**Key Learning:** 
1. Always use `homelab-manager.sh` option 3 (Rebuild & Deploy) after .env changes. Container restart ≠ env var reload.
2. PostgreSQL init scripts only run on FIRST database initialization. For existing databases, manually create users with `FIX_DATABASE_USERS.sh`.
3. Docker volumes may have wrong ownership - always check with `docker volume inspect` and fix with sudo chown.
