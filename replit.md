## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The NebulaCommand Dashboard features a cosmic theme with deep space backgrounds, animated starfields, nebula gradients, and glassmorphic UI panels, adhering to WCAG AA Accessibility standards. The Jarvis Voice Chat and mobile UI are fully responsive, incorporating cosmic themes and touch-friendly design. The Stream Bot uses a "candy theme" with gradients, glassmorphism, rounded edges, and glow effects.
