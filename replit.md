# Nebula Command

## Overview
Nebula Command is a creation engine designed for homelab management, AI-powered content creation, Discord community integration, and multi-platform streaming. It functions as a custom development and automation platform, similar to Replit but optimized for homelab environments, supporting distributed deployment across cloud and local infrastructure. Its core capabilities include a web-based dashboard for homelab control, a Discord bot for community management, a Stream bot for multi-platform streaming, and hybrid cloud/local AI services.

## User Preferences
- **Development Workflow:** Edit in Replit → Push to GitHub → Pull on servers
- **Database:** Shared PostgreSQL (Neon in dev, self-hosted in prod)
- **Secrets:** .env file (never commit), Replit Secrets in dev

## System Architecture

### Core Services
The platform is composed of three main services designed for distributed deployment:
*   **Dashboard (Next.js 14):** A web interface for homelab management, featuring real-time statistics, Docker container controls, SSH-based server metrics, deployment pipelines, a Monaco code editor, a visual website designer, and an OpenAI-powered AI chat assistant (Jarvis AI). It uses JWT-signed sessions and restricts file system access.
*   **Discord Bot (Node.js/React):** Manages Discord community features, including a ticket system, music, stream notifications, and analytics. It integrates with the Stream Bot for go-live alerts and with Plex and Lanyard for rich presence.
*   **Stream Bot (Node.js/React/Vite):** Handles multi-platform content posting and interaction across Twitch, YouTube, and Kick, supporting OAuth, token encryption, and rate limiting, along with an OBS overlay editor.

### Cross-Service Integration
Services utilize a shared PostgreSQL database and Redis for caching. The Stream Bot uses webhooks for Discord notifications, and the Dashboard and Discord Bot communicate via APIs.

### Deployment Architecture
The system employs a distributed deployment model where a cloud server hosts the Dashboard, Discord Bot, and Stream Bot, while a local Ubuntu Homelab hosts Plex, MinIO, Home Assistant, Ollama, and Stable Diffusion. Tailscale provides secure mesh networking, enabling cloud services to access local homelab resources.

### Database Schema
A shared PostgreSQL instance organizes data into distinct databases for each core service: `homelab_jarvis` (Dashboard), `discord_bot`, and `stream_bot`.

### Platform Architecture Expansion
The system features a three-layer design (Experience, Control Plane, Execution Plane) with an event-driven spine. It includes a Marketplace API for Docker packages, an Agent Orchestrator API for AI agents with function calling, and Service Discovery via a `service-map.yml`. A Creative Studio offers AI-powered content creation with multi-model support (OpenAI GPT-4o, Ollama, Stable Diffusion) and image generation (DALL-E 3).

### Remote Operations & Security
Capabilities include an SSH Terminal with xterm.js, an SFTP File Browser, server power controls (restart/shutdown), and Wake-on-LAN. Security enhancements involve JWT token validation for terminal access and `posixPath` resolution for SFTP to prevent path traversal. Secrets are managed via `.env` files and Replit Secrets, with pre-commit hooks and protected patterns safeguarding sensitive information.

### Production Build & Dashboard Enhancements
All API routes use a unified server configuration store. The dashboard includes real-time integration status, server management (add/edit/delete homelab servers), detailed health monitoring via SSH, activity logs, skeleton loaders, and improved error handling with mobile responsiveness.
