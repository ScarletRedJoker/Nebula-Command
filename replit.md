# Homelab Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive web-based dashboard for managing a Ubuntu 25.10 homelab server, offering a unified, user-friendly interface to reduce operational overhead and enhance server reliability. It includes all source code for production services, enabling easy development, testing, and deployment. The vision is to provide intelligent automation and monitoring for complex homelab setups, with capabilities such as one-click database deployments, game streaming integration, and robust domain health monitoring.

## User Preferences
- User: Evin
- Ubuntu 25.10 desktop homelab with Twingate VPN and dynamic DNS (ZoneEdit)
- Manages domains: rig-city.com, evindrake.net, scarletredjoker.com
- All projects stored in: `/home/evin/contain/` (production) and Replit (development)
- Development workflow: **Edit on Replit → Agent makes changes → Auto-sync to Ubuntu every 5 minutes**
- Services to manage:
  - Discord Ticket Bot (bot.rig-city.com) - Custom support bot with PostgreSQL
  - Stream Bot / SnappleBotAI (stream.rig-city.com) - AI Snapple facts for Twitch/Kick
  - Plex Server (plex.evindrake.net) - Media streaming
  - n8n Automation (n8n.evindrake.net) - Workflow automation
  - Static Website (scarletredjoker.com) - Personal website
  - VNC Desktop (vnc.evindrake.net) - Remote desktop access
  - Homelab Dashboard (host.evindrake.net) - Management UI
- Prefers centralized development environment with clean structure
- Needs public HTTPS access with automatic SSL (port forwarding configured)

### Database Architecture
A single PostgreSQL container (`discord-bot-db`) hosts multiple databases (`ticketbot`, `streambot`). Init scripts auto-configure databases and users.

### Unified Deployment System
- `homelab-manager.sh`: A single control panel for all operations including deployment, service control, database management, configuration, troubleshooting, code syncing, and updates.
- `docker-compose.unified.yml`: Orchestrates all 8 services.
- Caddy reverse proxy: Provides automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt.
- Automated Replit → Ubuntu Sync: Scripts (`sync-from-replit.sh`, `install-auto-sync.sh`) facilitate automatic code synchronization every 5 minutes.
