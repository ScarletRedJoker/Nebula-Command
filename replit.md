# Nebula Command Dashboard Project

## Overview
The Nebula Command Dashboard is a web-based interface for managing a homelab environment, orchestrating 15 Docker-based services across a Ubuntu 25.10 server via custom subdomains. The project aims to provide a centralized, robust, and secure platform for personal and community use, with a strategic vision to evolve into an app marketplace offering one-click deployments.

## User Preferences
- User: Evin
- Ubuntu 25.10 server at host.evindrake.net
- Project location: `/home/evin/contain/HomeLabHub`
- Development: Edit in cloud IDE → Push to GitHub → Pull on Ubuntu server
- All services use shared PostgreSQL (homelab-postgres) with individual databases
- Passwords: Stored securely in .env file (never commit to git)
- Managed domains: rig-city.com, evindrake.net, scarletredjoker.com

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The dashboard uses a Flask-based UI with Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js. Bot interfaces are built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. Design principles include mobile-first, responsive layouts, collapsible sidebars, bottom navigation, and skeleton loading states.

### Technical Implementations
The core system leverages Docker Compose for orchestrating services across a split deployment (Linode cloud and local Ubuntu host). A `bootstrap-homelab.sh` script ensures idempotent installations, and a `./homelab` script provides daily management (diagnostics, health checks, DB operations). Key features include an RBAC system, Docker lifecycle APIs, a marketplace deployment queue with rollback, and an audit trail. Jarvis, an AI-powered agentic remediation system with multi-model routing (OpenAI + Ollama), provides service diagnosis and auto-repair, including offline fallbacks.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard & AI:** Flask UI with Jarvis AI assistant (GPT-4o), Agent Swarm, Voice Interface, Docker/system monitoring, JWT token management, anomaly detection, and AI-powered infrastructure orchestration for deploying templated stacks via natural language.
- **Storage & Data:** NAS Management, Storage Monitor, Database Admin, File Manager, Plex Media Import, automated backup, and a unified storage service with dual-backend (local MinIO + cloud S3).
- **Bots:** Discord ticket bot with SLA automation, LLM-assisted triage, and sentiment analysis; multi-platform stream bot (Twitch/Kick/YouTube) with broadcaster onboarding and moderation.
- **Services:** Remote Ubuntu desktop (Host VNC), VS Code in browser (code-server), Plex, n8n, Home Assistant, and GameStream with Sunshine.
- **App Marketplace:** One-click deployment for various applications.

#### NAS Auto-Discovery
The local setup includes automatic NAS discovery that scans for NFS and SMB shares on the network:

```bash
# Auto-discover and mount NAS:
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/discover-nas.sh --auto-mount

# Discovery methods:
#   1. mDNS/Bonjour (Avahi) - finds .local hostnames
#   2. Network scan for NFS (port 2049) and SMB (ports 139, 445)
#   3. Common NAS hostname patterns (NAS*, synology*, qnap*, etc.)
#   4. UPnP/SSDP device discovery

# Manual mount options:
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/setup-nas-mounts.sh --nas-ip=192.168.0.100 --nfs-share=/nfs/networkshare
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/setup-nas-mounts.sh --nas-ip=192.168.0.100 --smb-share=public

# Skip NAS during bootstrap:
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/bootstrap-local.sh --skip-nas
```

Scripts:
- `deploy/local/scripts/discover-nas.sh` - Auto-discovery with scoring algorithm (prefers NFS, media shares)
- `deploy/local/scripts/setup-nas-mounts.sh` - Mount configuration with read-write access and Docker compatibility symlinks
- `deploy/local/scripts/diagnose-nas.sh` - Troubleshooting script for NAS connectivity and write access
- `deploy/local/scripts/bootstrap-local.sh` - Integrated bootstrap with `--skip-nas` option
- `scripts/secrets-manager.sh` - Centralized secrets encryption using Age

### NAS Upload Support

- Symlink `/mnt/nas/networkshare` → `/mnt/nas/all` for Docker compatibility
- Uploads via: `cp file.mkv /mnt/nas/networkshare/video/`
- Plex volumes remain read-only for safety

### Secrets Management
- Documentation: `docs/deploy/SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md`
- Script: `scripts/secrets-manager.sh` (Age-based encryption)
- Commands: `./scripts/secrets-manager.sh init|encrypt|decrypt|sync`

### Home Assistant
- URL: https://home.evindrake.net
- Config includes `external_url` for reverse proxy support
- Configuration template: `config/homeassistant/configuration.yaml`

### Deployment

#### Local Ubuntu Setup (with NAS)

```bash
# On local Ubuntu server:
cd /opt/homelab/HomeLabHub

# Complete bootstrap (NAS auto-discovery + Docker services)
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/bootstrap-local.sh

# Or step by step:
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/discover-nas.sh            # Discover NAS devices
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/setup-nas-mounts.sh        # Mount NAS
./deploy/local/start-local-services.sh                 # Start Docker
```

See `docs/deploy/LOCAL_UBUNTU_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

#### Linode Cloud Deployment

```bash
# On Linode server:
cd /opt/homelab/HomeLabHub

# Smart .env setup (preserves existing values, adds new vars)
./homelab sync-env
nano deploy/linode/.env  # Fill in any new variables

# Or manual setup (first time only):
# cp deploy/linode/.env.example deploy/linode/.env
# nano deploy/linode/.env

# Validate environment
./deploy/linode/scripts/validate-env.sh

# Run pre-flight checks
./deploy/linode/scripts/preflight.sh

# Deploy (with all safety checks)
./deploy/linode/scripts/deploy.sh

# Or preview first
./deploy/linode/scripts/deploy.sh --dry-run

# Rollback if needed
./deploy/linode/scripts/rollback.sh
```

See `docs/runbooks/LINODE_DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete deployment runbook.

#### Unified Deployment Pipeline

The `./homelab pipeline` command provides a "one script to rule them all" deployment experience:

```bash
# Run complete deployment with auto-fix (auto-detects local vs cloud)
./homelab pipeline

# Features:
#   1. Auto-detects role (local Ubuntu vs Linode cloud)
#   2. Validates environment and pre-flight checks
#   3. Auto-creates .env from template if missing
#   4. Attempts Docker start if not running
#   5. Provides NAS write access guidance
#   6. Runs health checks after deployment
#   7. Shows log summary at the end
```

The pipeline runs 5 steps automatically:
1. Environment validation
2. Pre-flight checks
3. Deploy services
4. Health checks
5. Log summary

### Desktop Integration (Gaming & Media)

The Ubuntu desktop provides seamless integration for gaming and media management:

#### NAS File Manager Integration
```bash
# One-time setup - adds NAS folders to Files sidebar
./scripts/setup-nas-desktop.sh

# Or install everything (gaming + NAS + WinApps)
./scripts/install-mode-switchers.sh
```

Desktop shortcuts for NAS:
- `scripts/desktop-entries/nas-media.desktop` - Main NAS folder
