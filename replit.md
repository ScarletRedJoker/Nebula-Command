# Nebula Command Dashboard Project

## Overview
The Nebula Command Dashboard is a web-based interface for managing a homelab environment consisting of a Ubuntu 25.10 server hosting 15 Docker-based services. These services, including homelab management, Discord/Twitch bots, media streaming, remote desktop, and home automation, are accessible via custom subdomains. The project aims to provide a centralized, robust, and secure platform, integrating various functionalities for personal and community use, with a vision to offer an app marketplace for one-click deployments.

## Deployment Architecture (Simplified - November 30, 2025)

**Philosophy: Simple, Straightforward, Automated, Self-Healing**

The project uses a unified deployment approach with ONE .env, ONE docker-compose.yml, and ONE homelab script.

### Service Distribution
**Linode Cloud (12 services):**
- Dashboard, Celery Worker, Discord Bot, Stream Bot
- PostgreSQL, Redis, n8n, Code-Server
- Caddy (reverse proxy), Static Sites (scarletredjoker.com, rig-city.com)

**Local Ubuntu Host (3 services via compose.local.yml):**
- Plex Media Server, Home Assistant, MinIO Storage
- VNC runs natively on host (not in Docker)

### Deployment Files
```
docker-compose.yml       # Main cloud services (Linode)
compose.local.yml        # Local services (Ubuntu host)
.env                     # All environment variables
.env.example             # Template with documentation
homelab                  # Management script
Caddyfile                # Reverse proxy configuration

deploy/scripts/
├── bootstrap.sh         # Unified deployment script
├── bootstrap-linode.sh  # Server setup (Docker, Tailscale, UFW)
├── bootstrap-local.sh   # Local host setup
└── health-check.sh      # Self-healing checks
```

### Quick Start (Linode Deployment)
```bash
# 1. Server setup (run as root on fresh Linode)
./deploy/scripts/bootstrap-linode.sh

# 2. Clone repo and configure
git clone https://github.com/username/HomeLabHub.git
cd HomeLabHub
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your credentials

# 3. Deploy services
./deploy/scripts/bootstrap.sh

# 4. Verify
./homelab status
```

### Daily Commands
```bash
./homelab up        # Start services
./homelab down      # Stop services
./homelab status    # Check status
./homelab logs      # View logs
./homelab fix       # Rebuild everything
./homelab health    # Run health checks
./homelab restart   # Restart all
```

## User Preferences
- User: Evin
- Ubuntu 25.10 server at host.evindrake.net
- Project location: `/home/evin/contain/HomeLabHub`
- Development: Edit in cloud IDE → Push to GitHub → Pull on Ubuntu server
- All services use shared PostgreSQL (homelab-postgres) with individual databases
- Main password: `Brs=2729` (used for most services)
- Managed domains: rig-city.com, evindrake.net, scarletredjoker.com

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The dashboard features a Flask-based UI with Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js for visualization. Bot interfaces are built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. UI/UX emphasizes a mobile-first design with responsive layouts, collapsible sidebars, bottom navigation, and skeleton loading states.

### Technical Implementations
The core system leverages Docker Compose for orchestrating 15 services across a split deployment architecture (Linode cloud and local Ubuntu host). A `bootstrap-homelab.sh` script handles idempotent fresh installations, while a `./homelab` script provides day-to-day management, including diagnostics, health checks, and database operations. Key features include an RBAC system, Docker lifecycle APIs, a marketplace deployment queue with rollback, and an audit trail system. The project also incorporates Jarvis, an AI-powered agentic remediation system for service diagnosis and auto-repair, with multi-model routing (OpenAI + Ollama) and offline fallbacks.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard & AI:** Flask UI with Jarvis AI assistant (GPT-4o), Agent Swarm, Voice Interface, Docker/system monitoring, JWT token management, and anomaly detection.
- **Storage & Data:** NAS Management, Storage Monitor, Database Admin, File Manager, Plex Media Import, and automated backup.
- **Bots:** Discord ticket bot with SLA automation, LLM-assisted triage, and sentiment analysis; multi-platform stream bot (Twitch/Kick/YouTube) with broadcaster onboarding, feature toggles, and enhanced moderation.
- **Services:** Remote Ubuntu desktop (Host VNC), VS Code in browser (code-server), Plex media server, n8n workflow automation, and Home Assistant.
- **App Marketplace:** One-click deployment for WordPress, Nextcloud, Gitea, Uptime Kuma, and Portainer.
- **Static Sites:** Hosting for rig-city.com and scarletredjoker.com with SEO, responsive design, and accessibility optimizations.
- **Notifications & Monitoring:** Multi-channel alerts (Discord, Email), Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for comprehensive observability.
- **Security:** Automatic SSL via Caddy/Let's Encrypt, environment-based secrets, isolated database credentials, rate limiting, and JWT authentication.

### System Design Choices
- **Containerization:** All services are Dockerized and managed by Docker Compose.
- **Centralized Database:** A single PostgreSQL 16 Alpine container (`homelab-postgres`) serves all services, with `database_orchestrator.py` handling migrations and health checks.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Caddy handles reverse proxying and automatic SSL. An Nginx sidecar proxy is used for `code-server` to handle `X-Frame-Options` headers.
- **Environment Management:** All configuration is managed via a single `.env` file.
- **Modular Architecture:** Designed for easy scalability and addition of new services.
- **Homelab Transformation:** Implemented an 8-phase roadmap covering configuration, modular service packaging, service discovery & networking (Consul, Traefik), database platform upgrade, observability, deployment automation, API Gateway & Auth, and DNS Automation (Cloudflare API).
