# Nebula Command Dashboard Project

## Overview
The Nebula Command Dashboard is a web-based interface for managing a homelab environment, orchestrating 15 Docker-based services across a Ubuntu 25.10 server via custom subdomains. The project aims to provide a centralized, robust, and secure platform for personal and community use, with a strategic vision to evolve into an app marketplace offering one-click deployments.

## User Preferences
- User: Evin
- Ubuntu 25.10 server at host.evindrake.net
- Project location: `/home/evin/contain/HomeLabHub`
- Development: Edit in cloud IDE → Push to GitHub → Pull on Ubuntu server
- All services use shared PostgreSQL (homelab-postgres) with individual databases
- Passwords: Stored securely in .env file (never commit to git)
- Managed domains: rig-city.com, evindrake.net, scarletredjoker.com

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The dashboard uses a Flask-based UI with Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js. Bot interfaces are built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. Design principles include mobile-first, responsive layouts, collapsible sidebars, bottom navigation, and skeleton loading states.

### Technical Implementations
The core system leverages Docker Compose for orchestrating services across a split deployment (Linode cloud and local Ubuntu host). A `bootstrap-homelab.sh` script ensures idempotent installations, and a `./homelab` script provides daily management (diagnostics, health checks, DB operations). Key features include an RBAC system, Docker lifecycle APIs, a marketplace deployment queue with rollback, and an audit trail. Jarvis, an AI-powered agentic remediation system with multi-model routing (OpenAI + Ollama), provides service diagnosis and auto-repair, including offline fallbacks.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard & AI:** Flask UI with Jarvis AI assistant (GPT-4o), Agent Swarm, Voice Interface, Docker/system monitoring, JWT token management, anomaly detection, and AI-powered infrastructure orchestration for deploying templated stacks via natural language.
- **Storage & Data:** NAS Management, Storage Monitor, Database Admin, File Manager, Plex Media Import, automated backup, and a unified storage service with dual-backend (local MinIO + cloud S3).
- **Bots:** Discord ticket bot with SLA automation, LLM-assisted triage, and sentiment analysis; multi-platform stream bot (Twitch/Kick/YouTube) with broadcaster onboarding and moderation.
- **Services:** Remote Ubuntu desktop (Host VNC), VS Code in browser (code-server), Plex, n8n, Home Assistant, and GameStream with Sunshine.
- **App Marketplace:** One-click deployment for various applications.
- **Static Sites:** Hosting for rig-city.com and scarletredjoker.com, optimized for SEO and accessibility.
- **Notifications & Monitoring:** Multi-channel alerts (Discord, Email), Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.
- **Security:** Automatic SSL via Caddy/Let's Encrypt, environment-based secrets, isolated database credentials, rate limiting, and JWT authentication.
- **New Features:** DNS Management Engine (Cloudflare API), Fleet Manager (Tailscale), Jarvis Code Service (AI code editing/deployment), Jarvis Website Builder (autonomous AI website generation), Deployment Guide, Setup Wizard, and Jarvis Codebase Access (AI interaction with codebase).

### System Design Choices
- **Containerization:** All services are Dockerized and managed by Docker Compose.
- **Centralized Database:** A single PostgreSQL 16 Alpine container (`homelab-postgres`) with `database_orchestrator.py` for migrations and health checks.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Caddy handles reverse proxying and automatic SSL, with an Nginx sidecar.
- **Environment Management:** Centralized configuration via a single `.env` file.
- **Modular Architecture:** Designed for scalability and easy service expansion.
- **Homelab Transformation:** Implemented an 8-phase roadmap covering configuration, modular service packaging, service discovery & networking, database platform upgrade, observability, deployment automation, API Gateway & Auth, and DNS Automation.
- **Deployment Automation:** Enhanced automation scripts for Tailscale, SSH key management, and cross-host health checks. The `./homelab` script is role-aware for managing services.

## External Dependencies

- **Discord API:** Discord ticket bot.
- **Twitch/Kick/YouTube APIs:** Multi-platform stream bot.
- **Plex Media Server:** Media streaming.
- **n8n:** Workflow automation.

- **Sunshine:** Game streaming server.

## Current Status (December 7, 2025)

### NAS Media Storage
- **NAS Model**: Zyxel NAS326
- **NAS IP**: 192.168.0.176
- **Hostname**: NAS326.local
- **Protocol**: NFS (via /nfs/networkshare) or SMB/CIFS
- **Media Folders**: video, music, photo, games
- **Host Mount Path**: `/mnt/nas/networkshare` (mounted from NAS)

### Plex Media Server
- **Access URL**: https://plex.evindrake.net
- **Container Image**: `lscr.io/linuxserver/plex:latest`
- **Network Mode**: host
- **Config Volume**: `/var/lib/plex/config:/config`
- **Media Volumes** (read-only):
  - `/mnt/nas/networkshare/video:/nas/video:ro`
  - `/mnt/nas/networkshare/music:/nas/music:ro`
  - `/mnt/nas/networkshare/photo:/nas/photo:ro`
- **Plex Library Paths** (inside container): `/nas/video`, `/nas/music`, `/nas/photo`
- **Environment**: PUID=1000, PGID=1000, TZ=America/New_York

#### Docker Run Command
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=plex \
  --net=host \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -e VERSION=docker \
  -v /var/lib/plex/config:/config \
  -v /mnt/nas/networkshare/video:/nas/video:ro \
  -v /mnt/nas/networkshare/music:/nas/music:ro \
  -v /mnt/nas/networkshare/photo:/nas/photo:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  lscr.io/linuxserver/plex:latest
```

#### NAS Auto-Discovery
The local setup includes automatic NAS discovery that scans for NFS and SMB shares on the network:

```bash
# Auto-discover and mount NAS:
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/discover-nas.sh --auto-mount

# Discovery methods:
#   1. mDNS/Bonjour (Avahi) - finds .local hostnames
#   2. Network scan for NFS (port 2049) and SMB (ports 139, 445)
#   3. Common NAS hostname patterns (NAS*, synology*, qnap*, etc.)
#   4. UPnP/SSDP device discovery

# Manual mount options:
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/setup-nas-mounts.sh --nas-ip=192.168.0.100 --nfs-share=/nfs/networkshare
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/setup-nas-mounts.sh --nas-ip=192.168.0.100 --smb-share=public

# Skip NAS during bootstrap:
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/bootstrap-local.sh --skip-nas
```

Scripts:
- `deploy/local/scripts/discover-nas.sh` - Auto-discovery with scoring algorithm (prefers NFS, media shares)
- `deploy/local/scripts/setup-nas-mounts.sh` - Mount configuration supporting both NFS and SMB/CIFS
- `deploy/local/scripts/bootstrap-local.sh` - Integrated bootstrap with `--skip-nas` option

### Deployment

#### Local Ubuntu Setup (with NAS)

```bash
# On local Ubuntu server:
cd /opt/homelab/HomeLabHub

# Complete bootstrap (NAS auto-discovery + Docker services)
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/bootstrap-local.sh

# Or step by step:
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/discover-nas.sh            # Discover NAS devices
sudo ./deploy/local/scripts/setup-nas-mounts.sh        # Mount NAS
./deploy/local/start-local-services.sh                 # Start Docker
```
