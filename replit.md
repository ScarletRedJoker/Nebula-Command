# Nebula Command

## Overview
Nebula Command is a self-managing, self-evolving creation engine for homelab management, AI-powered content creation, Discord community integration, and multi-platform streaming. It aims to be a custom development and automation engine, similar to Replit but tailored for homelab enthusiasts, supporting distributed deployment across cloud and local infrastructure.

**Core Capabilities:**
*   **Dashboard:** Web interface for homelab control, AI tools, and remote operations.
*   **Discord Bot:** Manages community, ticketing, notifications, and music.
*   **Stream Bot:** Facilitates multi-platform streaming management (Twitch/YouTube/Kick).
*   **AI Services:** Leverages a hybrid cloud/local AI setup (OpenAI + Ollama on GPU).

## User Preferences
- **Development Workflow:** Edit in Replit → Push to GitHub → Pull on servers
- **Database:** Shared PostgreSQL (Neon in dev, self-hosted in prod)
- **Secrets:** .env file (never commit), Replit Secrets in dev

### Deployment
1.  **Cloud (Linode)**: `ssh root@your-server → cd /opt/homelab/nebula-command/deploy/linode && ./deploy.sh`
2.  **Local Ubuntu**: `ssh user@your-server → cd /opt/homelab/nebula-command/deploy/local && ./deploy.sh`

Each server deploys ONLY its own services. They are separate and independent.

## System Architecture

### Core Services
The platform is built around three main services, designed for distributed deployment:

*   **Dashboard (Next.js 14):** A modern web interface (`services/dashboard-next/`) for homelab management. It features real-time stats, Docker container controls, SSH-based server metrics, deployment pipelines, a Monaco code editor, a visual website designer, and an OpenAI-powered AI chat assistant (Jarvis AI). It uses JWT-signed sessions for security and restricts file system access.
*   **Discord Bot (Node.js/React):** Located at (`services/discord-bot/`), this bot manages Discord community features including a ticket system, music, stream notifications, and analytics. It integrates with the Stream Bot for go-live alerts and with Plex and Lanyard for rich presence.
*   **Stream Bot (Node.js/React/Vite):** Found in (`services/stream-bot/`), this service handles multi-platform content posting and interaction across Twitch, YouTube, and Kick. It supports OAuth, token encryption, rate limiting, and an OBS overlay editor.

### Cross-Service Integration
Services share a PostgreSQL database and Redis for caching. The Stream Bot uses webhooks for Discord notifications. The Dashboard and Discord Bot communicate via APIs.

### Deployment Architecture
The system utilizes a distributed deployment model:
*   **Cloud Server:** Hosts the Dashboard, Discord Bot, and Stream Bot.
*   **Local Ubuntu Homelab:** Hosts Plex, MinIO, Home Assistant, Ollama, and Stable Diffusion.

Tailscale provides secure mesh networking, allowing cloud services to access local homelab resources via a sidecar container in `network_mode: host`.

### Database Schema
A shared PostgreSQL instance organizes data into distinct databases for each core service: `homelab_jarvis` (Dashboard), `discord_bot`, and `stream_bot`.

### Platform Architecture Expansion
The system has evolved to a three-layer design (Experience, Control Plane, Execution Plane) with an event-driven spine. New features include a Marketplace API for Docker packages, an Agent Orchestrator API for AI agents with function calling, and a Service Discovery mechanism for cross-server routing defined by a `service-map.yml`. The platform also includes a Creative Studio for AI-powered content creation with multi-model support (OpenAI GPT-4o, Ollama, Stable Diffusion) and image generation (DALL-E 3).

### Remote Operations & Security
New capabilities include an SSH Terminal with xterm.js, an SFTP File Browser for secure file management, server power controls (restart/shutdown), and Wake-on-LAN. Security enhancements include JWT token validation for terminal access and `posixPath` resolution for SFTP to prevent path traversal.

### Security & Secret Management
Secrets are managed via `.env` files (gitignore'd) and Replit Secrets. Pre-commit hooks (`./scripts/setup-git-secrets.sh`) and protected patterns safeguard sensitive information. A secret rotation procedure ensures timely updates across all environments.

## Recent Changes (January 2026)

### Creation Engine Features (Latest)
- **Ollama Model Catalog**: New `/models` page to browse, pull, and delete local LLM models with progress tracking
- **AI Code Generation**: New `/generate` page with natural language code creation, templates, and Monaco preview
- **Prompt Library**: New `/prompts` page for reusable text snippets with categories (code, content, image, chat, system)
- **Workflow Automation**: New `/workflows` page with triggers (schedule, webhook, event), actions (HTTP, SSH, Discord), and execution history
- **Quick Start Templates**: New `/quickstart` page with one-click project starters (React, Discord Bot, Flask API, Landing Page, CLI)

### Core Features Wired Up
- **SSH Key Auto-Generation**: Deploy scripts (`deploy/local/deploy.sh`, `deploy/linode/deploy.sh`) now auto-generate ed25519 SSH keys if missing and display the public key for easy server setup
- **Marketplace Real Deployment**: Marketplace API now executes actual SSH commands to deploy Docker apps with proper `docker pull && docker run` chaining, container ID tracking, and error message capture
- **IPMI Power Controls**: Dashboard servers page now shows IPMI power state and provides on/off/reset controls with confirmation dialogs
- **Dynamic Wake-on-LAN**: WoL button visibility now determined by `server.supportsWol` from API rather than hardcoded values
- **AI Agent Persistence**: Custom agents stored in database with full CRUD operations (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) and execution history tracking
- **qBittorrent VPN Fix**: Updated torrent-vpn config with port forwarding (6881) and DHT troubleshooting guide

### Production Build Fixes
- **Unified Server Config Store**: All API routes now use `lib/server-config-store.ts` for consistent async server lookups
- **Async/Await Fixes**: Fixed `getServerById()` and `getAllServers()` calls that weren't awaited in IPMI, power, and deploy routes
- **Type Safety**: Added `getDefaultSshKeyPath()` fallback for optional `keyPath` fields to prevent TypeScript errors
- **Prerender Compatibility**: Added `force-dynamic` export to platform-status route to prevent static generation errors
