# Homelab Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive web-based dashboard for managing a Ubuntu 25.10 homelab server. Its primary purpose is to provide a unified, user-friendly interface to reduce operational overhead, enhance server reliability, and enable intelligent automation and monitoring for complex homelab setups. Key capabilities include one-click database deployments, game streaming integration, robust domain health monitoring, and integrations with Google Services and Smart Home platforms. The project aims to provide all necessary source code for easy development, testing, and deployment, with a focus on production readiness.

### Database Architecture
A single PostgreSQL container manages multiple databases (`ticketbot`, `streambot`).

### Unified Deployment System
- `homelab-manager.sh`: Central script for all operations.
- `docker-compose.unified.yml`: Orchestrates all services.
- Caddy reverse proxy: Provides automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt.
- Automated Replit → Ubuntu Sync: Scripts for 5-minute code synchronization.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Dashboard**: Cosmic theme with animated starfields, nebula gradients, and glassmorphic panels for a futuristic feel.
- **Stream Bot**: Candy-themed UI with vibrant gradients, glassmorphism, and smooth animations for a playful experience.
- Cohesive design language across the platform for a unified user experience.

### Production Readiness
- **Security**: Comprehensive security audit (8.2/10), environment variable-based secrets, robust OAuth, automatic HTTPS, SQL injection prevention via ORMs, secure Docker configurations, secure session management, input validation, rate limiting, and CORS configuration.
- **Performance**: Health check endpoints, database connection pooling, optimized Docker images.
- **Error Handling**: React Error Boundaries, comprehensive logging, user-friendly messages, automatic retry logic.

### Vision: AI-First Homelab Copilot
Jarvis is designed to be an intelligent automation platform that pairs high-contrast observability dashboards with conversational AI workflows. The platform prioritizes:
1. **AI-Orchestrated Operations**: Self-diagnosing issues, suggesting fixes, and executing remediation with user approval
2. **Mission Control UI**: Dashboard serves as command center with real-time status, not just a static monitoring tool
3. **Actionable Intelligence**: AI assistant integrates with Docker SDK, system logs, and network tools to provide real solutions
4. **Safe Automation**: Policy-checked execution layer with confirmation loops, audit logging, and rollback capabilities
