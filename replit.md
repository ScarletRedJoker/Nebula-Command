# Homelab Dashboard Project

## Overview
This Replit workspace is the centralized development environment for all homelab services. It provides a comprehensive web-based dashboard for managing a Ubuntu 25.10 homelab server, plus all source code for production services. The workspace structure allows for easy development, testing, and deployment. The business vision is to provide a unified, user-friendly interface for managing complex homelab setups, reducing operational overhead, and enhancing server reliability through intelligent automation and monitoring. Key capabilities include one-click database deployments, game streaming integration, and robust domain health monitoring.

### Database Architecture

**Single PostgreSQL Container** (`discord-bot-db`) hosts multiple databases:
- `ticketbot` database (Discord Bot)
- `streambot` database (Stream Bot)

**Auto-Configuration System:**
- Init scripts in `config/postgres-init/` create databases and users on first container startup.
- `fix-existing-deployment.sh` is used to add the `streambot` database to existing volumes.

**Unified Deployment System:**
- `homelab-manager.sh` - **ONE UNIFIED CONTROL PANEL** for all operations (primary interface):
  - Full deployment, restart, rebuild options
  - Service control (start, stop, restart individual services)
  - Database management (ensure databases exist, check status)
  - Configuration (generate/edit .env, view current config)
  - Troubleshooting (logs, health checks, full diagnostics)
  - **Code Sync** (sync from Replit, install auto-sync, check sync status)
  - Updates (pull latest Docker images)
  - Information (container details, service URLs)
- `docker-compose.unified.yml` orchestrates all 8 services
- Caddy reverse proxy with automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt
- All deployment scripts now accessible via unified menu (no need to remember separate commands)

**Automated Replit → Ubuntu Sync:**
- `deployment/sync-from-replit.sh` - Manual sync script (pull latest changes and auto-deploy affected services)
- `deployment/install-auto-sync.sh` - Install systemd timer for automatic syncing every 5 minutes
- `deployment/manual-sync.sh` - Quick manual sync shortcut
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude service logs/data and prevent sync conflicts
