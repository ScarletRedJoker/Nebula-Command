# Nebula Command

## Overview
Nebula Command is a creation engine designed for comprehensive homelab management, AI-powered content creation, Discord community integration, and multi-platform streaming. It provides a unified solution for digital creators and homelab enthusiasts, streamlining content generation, distribution, and community engagement. The platform is optimized for distributed deployment across cloud and local infrastructure, aiming to be a central hub for digital creation and homelab operations, with future potential for integration with games, AR/VR, and simulation environments.

## User Preferences
- **Development Workflow:** Edit locally → Push to GitHub → Pull on servers
- **Database:** Shared PostgreSQL (Neon in dev, self-hosted in prod)
- **Secrets:** .env file (never commit)

## System Architecture

### Core Services
- **Dashboard (Next.js 14):** Web interface for homelab management, Docker controls, SSH metrics, deployment pipelines, code editor, visual website designer, and Jarvis AI assistant.
- **Discord Bot (Node.js/React):** Customizable bot for community management with per-server identity and granular feature toggles.
- **Stream Bot (Node.js/React/Vite):** Multi-platform content posting across Twitch, YouTube, and Kick.
- **Nebula Agent (Node.js/Express):** Runs on Windows VM for health monitoring, command execution, model management, and service control.

### Cross-Service Integration and Deployment
Services share a PostgreSQL database and Redis for caching, communicating via webhooks and APIs. The system employs a three-tier distributed deployment model leveraging Ubuntu Host (Home) for AI services, Linode (Cloud) for core web and bot services, and Tailscale for secure mesh networking.

### Platform Architecture
A three-layer design (Experience, Control Plane, Execution Plane) supports a Marketplace API for Docker packages, an Agent Orchestrator API for managing AI agents, and Service Discovery via `service-map.yml`. It includes a Creative Studio for AI content generation and a Jarvis AI Orchestrator for multi-agent job management and autonomous code development.

### AI Node Management & Creative Engine
The system monitors AI node health and performance, featuring APIs for Speech, Job Scheduling, Training, and Embeddings/RAG. The Creative Studio supports advanced AI image generation (text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting, ControlNet, upscaling, face swap) with job persistence. A ComfyUI Service Supervisor ensures robust operation of the image generation pipeline, including automatic restarts and health checks.

### Key Features
Nebula Command provides a comprehensive suite of features including:
- **OOTB Setup Wizard:** Guided platform configuration.
- **Command Center & Deploy Center:** Unified control and remote deployment.
- **Services & Secrets Manager:** Container, service, and credential management.
- **Jarvis AI & Creative Studio:** AI chat assistance and advanced image generation.
- **AI Models & Workflows:** Model marketplace, management, and multi-step AI automation.
- **Agent Builder & Pipelines:** Custom AI agent configuration and deployment automation.
- **Bot Editor & Servers:** Discord bot customization and server monitoring.
- **Windows VM & Domains:** GPU server management and DNS/SSL management.
- **Marketplace:** Docker package installation.
- **AI Developer:** An autonomous code modification system with human approval gates.
- **AI Influencer / Video Automation Pipeline:** Tools for character persistence, script-to-video generation, prompt chaining, batch content, and scheduled jobs.
- **Automated Deployment and Node Auto-Configuration:** Bootstrap scripts for dynamic, hardware-aware configuration of AI services (Ollama, ComfyUI, Stable Diffusion) on various nodes.

### Architectural Principles
The architecture is designed for future extensibility with core interfaces for services, rendering, pipelines, and extensions, facilitating integration with game engines, AR/VR runtimes, and simulation engines through a dynamic service registry and plugin system.
