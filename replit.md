# Nebula Command - HomeLabHub Platform

## Overview
Nebula Command, also known as the HomeLabHub Platform, is a comprehensive suite for homelab management, Discord community integration, and multi-platform streaming. It comprises a Dashboard for homelab control and AI assistance, a Discord Bot for community and notification management, and a Stream Bot for automated content posting across streaming platforms. The platform's vision is to offer a unified control plane for homelab enthusiasts, providing advanced features for automation, monitoring, and interaction within their digital environments.

## User Preferences
- **User:** Evin
- **Managed Domains:** rig-city.com, evindrake.net, scarletredjoker.com
- **Development Workflow:** Edit in Replit → Push to GitHub → Pull on Ubuntu servers
- **Database:** Shared PostgreSQL (Neon in dev, homelab-postgres in prod)
- **Secrets:** .env file (never commit), Replit Secrets in dev

### Deployment Preference
When Evin asks to "deploy", this means:
1. **Linode**: `ssh root@linode.evindrake.net` → `cd /opt/homelab/HomeLabHub/deploy/linode && ./deploy.sh`
2. **Local Ubuntu**: `ssh evin@host.evindrake.net` → `cd /opt/homelab/HomeLabHub/deploy/local && ./deploy.sh`

Each server deploys ONLY its own services. They are separate and independent.

## System Architecture

### Core Services
The platform consists of three main services:
-   **Dashboard (Flask/Python)**: A web interface for homelab management, AI assistance (Jarvis), Docker control, NAS management, fleet control, KVM gaming mode switching, and Cloudflare DNS management. It features a professional dark theme.
-   **Discord Bot (Node.js/React)**: Handles Discord community management, including a ticket system, music bot, stream notifications, and analytics. It integrates with the Stream Bot for go-live alerts and offers multi-tenant security.
-   **Stream Bot (Node.js/React/Vite)**: Manages multi-platform content posting and interaction across Twitch, YouTube, and Kick. It supports OAuth, per-user personalization, token encryption, rate limiting, and anti-spam measures, with a modernized UI.

### Cross-Service Integration
Services share a PostgreSQL database and Redis for caching. The Stream Bot uses webhooks for Discord go-live notifications. The Dashboard and Discord Bot communicate via APIs. The Discord Bot integrates with Plex for "Now Playing" status and Lanyard for rich presence. The entire system is multi-tenant with user roles and RBAC.

### Deployment and Hosting
The system is deployed on two independent servers:
-   **Linode Cloud**: Hosts the Dashboard, Discord Bot, and Stream Bot.
-   **Local Ubuntu**: Hosts local homelab services like Plex, MinIO, and Home Assistant.
Each server utilizes separate deployment scripts.

### Tailscale Connectivity
Linode utilizes a Tailscale sidecar container to access local services on the Ubuntu homelab, including Plex, Home Assistant, MinIO, and a KVM/Sunshine gaming VM. The `tailscale` container operates in `network_mode: host` to route all Linode container traffic through the Tailscale network.

### Database Schema
A shared PostgreSQL instance organizes data into distinct databases for each service:
-   `homelab_jarvis`: Dashboard data (AI conversations, Docker, audit logs).
-   `discord_bot`: Discord Bot data (tickets, messages, server configs, stream notifications).
-   `stream_bot`: Stream Bot data (configurations, platform connections, message history).

### KVM Gaming VM (Sunshine/Moonlight)
A KVM VM named `RDPWindows` is configured with GPU passthrough (NVIDIA RTX 3060) and a Tailscale IP (`100.118.44.102`). It features robust startup scripts that handle GPU D3cold recovery, stale process cleanup, retry logic, and health monitoring. Moonlight can connect via Tailscale or local LAN.

### Local Ubuntu Server Configuration
The local Ubuntu server mounts a NAS share (`//192.168.0.185/networkshare`) at `/srv/media` using CIFS with `noauto,x-systemd.automount` for boot safety. Key services run in Docker containers, including Plex, Home Assistant, MinIO, and Caddy.

### Stream Bot OBS Overlays
The Stream Bot offers an overlay editor for OBS, allowing visual drag-and-drop customization of text, images, and alerts. Overlays can be exported as JSON or saved in-memory. Specific URLs are provided for Spotify, YouTube, and custom overlays.

### Recent Fixes (January 2026)
- **Stream Bot Rate Limiter Fixed**: Increased auth limit from 5 to 50 requests, added skipSuccessfulRequests for OAuth flows
- **Discord Bot Dashboard Simplified**: Reduced from 11 tabs to 5 core tabs (Overview, Tickets, Streams, Welcome, Commands) + "More Tools" dropdown
- **qBittorrent + VPN Setup Added**: Created deploy/local/torrent-vpn/ with gluetun container for private torrenting

### Discord Bot Stream Notifications
Stream notifications require explicit setup by configuring a channel and tracking streamers via Discord commands. Detection works by monitoring Discord presence and polling Twitch/YouTube APIs. Users must link their streaming platforms to Discord for detection.
